Gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, weighted and unweighted closed for solutions.

Loss: Empirical risk based on squared loss

Error: Root mean square error

Compares coefficients, number of iterations, and runtime for different algorithms across various learning rates, including adaptive.

Creates visualizations for training and validation errors as functions of polynomial degree and regularization parameters to determine optimal polynomial complexity and regularization with respect to underfitting and overfitting risk.
